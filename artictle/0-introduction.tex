\subsection{Introduction}

% \subsubsection{\textit{Purpose}}
The following document outline all design documentation of the smart livestock monitoring
System. This document is separated in section, you can jump to any specific section you want to learn more
about related to the livestock monitoring system. You are advice to read this document if you want to
learn more about the design principle and choices of the livestock monitoring system. The information on this document will
enable you to not only understand the system but will tell you how to trouble shoot the system if anything went
wrong and also extend the functionality of the system if you so choose to.

\subsubsection{\textit{Scope}}
The document will cover design consideration, Assumptions, goals and guideline. It will give you enough information
about Architectural strategies, System architectural and Functional flow of the livestock monitoring system.

\subsubsection{\textit{Audience}}
The design documentation is for anyone who want to learn more about the livestock monitoring system,
How it is design from ground up and how they can extend the system to solve other problem. This document it also
good for any engineers who want to replicate the system on their own.
