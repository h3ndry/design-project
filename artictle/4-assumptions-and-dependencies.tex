\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}

The livestock monitoring system is developed with the assumption its users
have access to a web browser. Weather that be a phone or computer, few of the
popular web browser include Chrome, Firefox and Brave. This is by design, A web
browser is cross-platform by default, that mean weather you are using a
Windows, Mac or Linux you can still access the system.

We also developed the system under the assumption that where the livestock
is being kept the is internet connection, or at least we can install one. The
Micro controller need internet access to be able to send data that we need to
monitor the livestock and for the most part we assume that our users know how
to access the internet and can be able to read chart assumptions or dependencies regarding the software and hardware and their use. These may concern such issues as related software and hardware, end user characteristics etc

\subsubsection{Related software and hardware}

The system is related in most way to a car tracking system, The difference is a
car does not need a solar power since it can get power from the car while
the livestock monitoring system  you need creative way to supplier power to the
system

\subsubsection{End-user characteristics}

Describe any global limitations or constraints that have a significant impact
on the design of the system's software (and describe the associated impact).
Such constraints may be imposed by any of the following (the list is not
exhaustive):

% - Hardware or software environment
% - End-user environment
% - Availability or volatility of resources
% - Other requirements described in the requirements specification
