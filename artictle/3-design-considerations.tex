\subsection{Design considerations}

The first issue that need to be solved on the design consideration is the power
supply for the Micro controller. We need to make sure that the battery last
longer and became rechargeable over the life span of the livestock

The second is weather condition, The device need to withstand harsh weather
condition since livestock can be farmed outside

The third design issue is the wight of the device, We need the device to be light as possible that it
does not affect the growth of the livestock.
