\subsection{Goals and guidelines}

The development of livestock tracking system follows the Unix philosophy that
emphasis building simple, compact, clear, modular, and extensible code that can
be easily maintain and repurposed by developer other than its creator

While developing the system, the main focus was power consumption, I wanted the
system to consume less power as possible. A lot have been done on the Micro controller
to make sure that the power consumption is low as possible, such as making sure that the bluetooth
module is turned off, and only use the wife module, and lower than the CPU clock rate.
I also made the CPU to do one job and one job only to make it last longer on a single

The design of the tracking hardware is design to be resisted to hash weather condition, to be
robust. I made sure it does not fall easy when attached to the livestock. I also choose to make the
box/ case to package the ESP32 black. This will make sure that is became invisible as possible to the
livestock or not fool the livestock to think that is food
