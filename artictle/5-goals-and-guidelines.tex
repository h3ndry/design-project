\section{Goals and guidelines (1/2 page)}

Describe any goals, guidelines, principles, or priorities which dominate or embody the design of the system's software. Such goals might be:

    • The KISS principle ("Keep it simple stupid!")
    • Emphasis on speed versus memory use
    • Working, looking, or "feeling" like an existing product

For each such goal or guideline, unless it is implicitly obvious, describe the reason for its desirability. Feel free to state and describe each goal in its own sub-subsection if you wish.
